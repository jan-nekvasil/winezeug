This is the upstream for the Wine icon thumbnailer script originally available in Ubuntu as gnome-exe-thumbnailer.

It's just a bash script so it could be ported easily to other distros and desktop environments (provided they have scriptable thumbnailers).  On Gnome it must be enabled via installation of gconf schemas.


It requires the icoutils package (which should contain wrestool as well).
